# Otávio Marinho - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, my name is Otávio! I want to switch careers to the data field, and I'm starting this repository with the goal of showcasing some Data Analysis skills while studying Data Science and, eventually, Artificial Intelligence.

I acquired most of my knowledge in the field through DataCamp (made possible by my fluency in English), following recommendations from colleagues. I currently hold a Professional Data Analyst certification. My background in technology comes from my time at the Federal University of Itajubá, where I studied Computer Science, but I couldn't continue the course. Since then, I’ve studied for competitive exams, worked as an entrepreneur, and as a real estate agent.

My current goal is to grow in my career, learn useful and interesting tools while challenging myself along the way.
